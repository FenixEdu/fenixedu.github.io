## Overview

[Getting started](#quickstart) with the FenixEdu™ project is easy. You can learn more about our [methodology][Methodology],
learn how to contribute with our [tutorials][Tutorials], and explore our [sub-projects][SubProjects].

Hoping that FenixEdu™ solutions may be useful to others, we share our software
with the community whenever possible. FenixEdu™ comprehends a range of solutions,
from academic and administrative processes to general purpose software libraries.

We also share our methodology and our knowledge through tutorials. This documentation page intends
to get you started and help you resolve any issue that you might encounter while contributing to our codebase.


### Quickstart
Currently, we are working on a solution that uses Virtual Machines to provide a really quickstart and have a FenixEdu™ installation up and running.
For now, you can follow a tutorial to [install FenixEdu™ in your development machine][install FenixEdu™ in your development machine].

### Create Your Own Application

If you wish to develop your own application under our software ecosystem, you can follow [this tutorial][Create your own application].

### Explore the Sub-Projects

The FenixEdu™ project comprehends several sub-projects that can be composed and deployed within the same instalation. If you want to know more about these sub-projects, feel free to browse their respective documentation.

### Getting Involved

There are many ways to get involved in Project FénixEdu. This section describes
how to collaborate on this project.

#### Road-map Discussion

Normally, we have weekly meetings where we discuss the progress of current work
and update milestone predictions. We also use these meetings to discuss serious bugs
and urgent unpredicted features.

About every six months the core development team will get together to discuss
major features and rewrites. It is during these discussions that new features
should be proposed. We usually don't publicise these meetings, however if you
wish to participate in these discussions either regarding the whole project or
a specific sub-project, let us know.

Each sub-project has it's own road-map that is posted on the sub-projects' 
web-site.

#### Contributing

Contributing can be as easy as submitting a bug report or creating a new issue.
If you want to contribute code, simply fork a repository and submit a pull-request.
Make sure to check the projects [methodology][methodology] for details on how to proceed.

#### Joining The Team

If you wish to participate further in the project, drop us an email with your
CV at [dsi@ist.utl.pt][dsi@ist.utl.pt]. We're always looking to expand our
community.
