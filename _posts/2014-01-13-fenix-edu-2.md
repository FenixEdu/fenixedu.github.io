### Better Bookmarks
In previous versions of FenixEdu, it was not possible to bookmark top-level functionalities (the tabs) due to security restrictions of the navigation architecture. In this new version of FenixEdu, we improved that architecture, and you can now bookmark top-level functionalities properly without such constraints, and quicly access your most-used functionalities.

### Student Analytics
Students now have access to visualizations that provide information and statistics about their marksheets, courses, and the progress on their degree completion. It is also possible to compare the results of their courses with the other instances in different semesters. In this first version, we are only providing a couple of visualizations, but we intend to provide more insightful ones in the near future.

In Figure 2, you can preview the first version of the global statistics view for a particular student. This view provides information about the student progress in his different registrations.

Another view present in this first version, accessible by the student curriculum page, is the execution course detailed view, where the student can view his and his colleagues grades in that course evaluations. Such information can be visualized through two diagrams: sunburst (Figure 3) and histogram (Figure 4). Additionaly, the student can compare his semester with other semesters of the same curricular course.

FenixEdu is now built on top of the Bennu Framework. Bennu Framework simplifies the development of web applications providing cross-cutting concerns out-of-the-box. With FenixEdu 2.0, we are also releasing version 2.0 of the Bennu Framework.

### New file support architecture
The introduction of Bennu 2.0 allows moving FenixEdu file support from DSpace to a more modern architecture.

### New scheduling architecture
Removed the need for an external service to run cron jobs, with the ability to configure and run them directly inside the application.

Kerberos usage is deprecated since version 1.0, and now has been completely removed.
