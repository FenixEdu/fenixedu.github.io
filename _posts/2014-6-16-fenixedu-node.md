## FenixEdu™ Node - VM based FenixEdu deployment

Four years ago, getting FenixEdu running was a heck of a problem. You had to install Java, MySQL and a particular version of Tomcat, ant and a few other utilities to get your installation of FenixEdu, even if you were just trying FenixEdu.

In 4 years, FenixEdu changed a lot. You can follow <a href="http://fenixedu.org/dev/tutorials/install-fenix-edu/">this</a> guide, and in 25 minutes you have an installation of FenixEdu up and running.

This is still quite a lot to do. So we are releasing today a VM version of FenixEdu in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format">Open Virtualization Format</a>. You just need to drag and drop it into Virtual Box, start the VM, open the browser and you have a FenixEdu running.

You can download the latest file <a href="https://fenix-ashes.ist.utl.pt/files/fenixedu-latest.ova">here</a> and if you want we also have a <a href="https://fenix-ashes.ist.utl.pt/files/fenixedu-latest.torrent">torrent</a> of it.

Is that simple, as you can see:
