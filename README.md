==================

[TÃ©cnico Lisboa](http://www.ist.utl.pt) is Portugal's most prestigious school of engineering. [DSI](http://dsi.ist.utl.pt) is the school's computer and network services. We have been developing open source software, mainly directed at solving problems for higher education institutions, since 2001. Every institution involved in higher education is different and has its own needs and processes. However, this is not incompatible with different institutions sharing ideas, resources and solutions. Hoping our solutions may be useful to others, we share our software with the community whenever possible. We develop a wide range of solutions, from academic and administrative processes to general purpose software libraries.

This page is mainly intended for developers and will soon contain information about the development processes adopted by DSI.
